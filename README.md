Summary of my Assignment on Data Visualisations based on a data set of US Visa applicants in 2015 where I compared size of each occupation, wages as well as visa application success rates between data related and non-data related jobs.
Data was wrangled using pandas and I created an output excel from Pandas with relevant data to create the visualisations seen in the PowerPoint.

# Assignment was completed using:
1. Python Pandas library for Data cleaning and manipulation
2. Microsoft Excel for visualisations

# How I built the PowerPoint slides:
* First, I wanted to summarise what the visualisations are about to give the reader a preamble of what to expect.
![Summary Slide](/assets/Summary.PNG)
* Moving on, I wanted to zoom into the demographic we are dealing with here. Data of software engineers is excluded from TreeMap on the right as data size is greater than half of all jobs and it doesn't add much to the visualisation, so I just included it as a footnote.

* Now that we have introduced the demographic, I wanted to show the varying paid and prevailing wages among applicants of different types of visas between the two data-related jobs. Greencard applicants are highlighted in green for better effect and I've left foot notes indicating small sample sizes so that readers can take the corresponding bars with a pinch of salt.

* Moving on, I wanted to zoom in further to just compare Greencard applicants vs non-Greencard applicants between data analysts and data scientists. This shows the disparity between greencard applicants and non-Greencard applicants in terms of wages.

* In the fourth slide, I wanted to show the application success rate between data and non-data related jobs. There is a 1% difference between denial rates for data and non-data related jobs, but that could also be attributed to sample size since overall sample size is 166k applicants and data-related jobs simply account for less than 5% of all applicants.

* In the last slide, I wanted to further highlight the income disparity of all applicants across the US. Highlighting that 43 of 50 states have applicants with incomes lower than the mean. This would further mean that there is a upward skewing of mean annual wages contributed by high earners in certain states.

## With that, I end my presentation :)
