#This repository contains:
Summary of my Assignment on Data Visualisations based on a data set of US Visa applicants in 2015 where I compared size of each occupation, wages as well as visa application success rates between data related and non-data related jobs.

#Assignment was completed using:
1. Python Pandas library for Data cleaning and manipulation
2. Microsoft Excel for visualisations

The PowerPoint shows the final product of my visualisations.

How I built the PowerPoint slides:
First, I wanted to summarise what the visualisations are about to give the reader a preamble of what to expect.
